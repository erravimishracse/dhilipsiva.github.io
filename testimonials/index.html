            dhilipsiva is one of the few self-driven guys that I know of, with a strong focus on building software programs and application, from a very early stage in his life. I know him since my second year of Engineering which happened to be his first year, and right at that time he had started building simple game softwares. That was pretty impressive of him. During the next 3 years in our college, I had observed him taking part in student initiatives with a few other students in promoting open source software usage/development and helping his student friends in learning various programming languages. Later he went on to work for various startups and had done some amazing code contributions. In short he is a self taught code-geek. And am happy to be connected with him. Here is wishing him the best on his future endevours.
